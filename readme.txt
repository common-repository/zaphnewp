== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How does Zaphne work? =

*Like a research assistant that doesn’t sleep, Zaphne is a proprietary algorithm that finds and creates keyword rich content resources – including pictures and video – that posts automatically to your WordPress blog, complete with keywords and links to source articles.

= Does Zaphne really help SEO? =

*Clearly, the creation of regular relevant content is the single most important factor impacting SEO rankings.  But while over 3 million blogs are created each month, only 5% are updated regularly – essentially abandoned – due to a lack of fresh creative content.  In fact, we created Zaphne to solve this very problem. Zaphne also plays very nicely with other SEO plugins, and it has been tested on hundreds of sites.  Proven to boost search engine visibility on its own, it boosts your SEO strategy with regular activity, and even brings back dead blogs to life!

= Is this another RSS feed? =
*
Nope.  RSS feeds are a simple integration with content that other people write. Zaphne is fresh content that is posted to your blog automatically, content that search engines view as new.  Think of us as having the convenience of an RSS feed without the plagiarism.

= Will this write my blog for me? =
*Kind of.  Some people just use the automatic post resources as their blog content, while others use our content as a jumping off point for inspiration.   We do the heavy lifting - you write the songs that make the whole world sing.

= Will anyone get the same content as me? =
*Negative, Ghost Rider.  Zaphne is built to create unique content assets for each site where it is installed.  Even if the person sitting in the next cubicle is also writing about guinea pigs, you can be assured that their Zaphne blog content will be different than yours.
